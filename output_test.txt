The language grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare.[13] Hoare has stated that the project was possibly named after rust fungi and that the name is also a subsequence of "robust".[23] Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009[13] and announced it in 2010.[24][25] The same year, work shifted from the initial compiler (written in OCaml) to an LLVM-based self-hosting compiler written in Rust.[26] Named rustc, it successfully compiled itself in 2011.[27]The first numbered pre-alpha release of the Rust compiler occurred in January 2012.[28] Rust 1.0, the first stable release, was released on May 15, 2015.[29][30] Following 1.0, stable point releases are delivered every six weeks, while features are developed in nightly Rust with daily releases, then tested with beta releases that last six weeks.[31][32] Every two to three years, a new Rust "edition" is produced. This is to provide an easy reference point for changes due to the frequent nature of Rust's train release schedule, as well as to provide a window to make limited breaking changes. Editions are largely compatible.[33]Along with conventional static typing, before version 0.4, Rust also supported typestates. The typestate system modeled assertions before and after program statements, through use of a special check statement. Discrepancies could be discovered at compile time, rather than at runtime, as might be the case with assertions in C or C++ code. The typestate concept was not unique to Rust, as it was first introduced in the language NIL.[34] Typestates were removed because in practice they were little used,[35] though the same functionality can be achieved by leveraging Rust's move semantics.[36]The object system style changed considerably within versions 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 of Rust. Version 0.2 introduced classes for the first time, and version 0.3 added several features, including destructors and polymorphism through the use of interfaces. In Rust 0.4, traits were added as a means to provide inheritance; interfaces were unified with traits and removed as a separate feature. Classes were also removed and replaced by a combination of implementations and structured types.[37]Starting in Rust 0.9 and ending in Rust 0.11, Rust had two built-in pointer types: ~ and @, simplifying the core memory model. It reimplemented those pointer types in the standard library as Box and (the now removed) Gc.In January 2014, before the first stable release, Rust 1.0, the editor-in-chief of Dr. Dobb's, Andrew Binstock, commented on Rust's chances of becoming a competitor to C++ and to the other up-and-coming languages D, Go, and Nim (then Nimrod). According to Binstock, while Rust was "widely viewed as a remarkably elegant language", adoption slowed because it repeatedly changed between versions.[38]In August 2020, Mozilla laid off 250 of its 1,000 employees worldwide as part of a corporate restructuring caused by the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.[39][40] Among those laid off were most of the Rust team,[41][better source needed] while the Servo team was completely disbanded.[42][better source needed] The event raised concerns about the future of Rust.[43]In the following week, the Rust Core Team acknowledged the severe impact of the layoffs and announced that plans for a Rust foundation were underway. The first goal of the foundation would be taking ownership of all trademarks and domain names, and also take financial responsibility for their costs.[44]On February 8, 2021 the formation of the Rust Foundation was officially announced by its five founding companies (AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft,[45][46] and Mozilla).[47][48]On April 6, 2021, Google announced support for Rust within Android Open Source Project as an alternative to C/C++.[49]The language grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare.[13] Hoare has stated that the project was possibly named after rust fungi and that the name is also a subsequence of "robust".[23] Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009[13] and announced it in 2010.[24][25] The same year, work shifted from the initial compiler (written in OCaml) to an LLVM-based self-hosting compiler written in Rust.[26] Named rustc, it successfully compiled itself in 2011.[27]The first numbered pre-alpha release of the Rust compiler occurred in January 2012.[28] Rust 1.0, the first stable release, was released on May 15, 2015.[29][30] Following 1.0, stable point releases are delivered every six weeks, while features are developed in nightly Rust with daily releases, then tested with beta releases that last six weeks.[31][32] Every two to three years, a new Rust "edition" is produced.
